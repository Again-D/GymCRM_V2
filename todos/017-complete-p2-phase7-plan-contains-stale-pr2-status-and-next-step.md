# [P2] Phase 7 plan contains stale PR #2 status / next-step references

## Problem
The Phase 7 plan still states PR #2 is `OPEN / CLEAN` and recommends starting after PR #2 merge, but PR #2 is already merged. This makes execution context and recommended next steps outdated and can confuse kickoff sequencing.

## Suggested fix
- Update `Branch / Execution Context` to reflect PR #2 and PR #3 merged state
- Update `Dependencies` and `Recommended Next Step` sections to remove `PR #2 merge` prerequisite
- Optionally mention Phase 6 UX follow-up (PR #3) merged
